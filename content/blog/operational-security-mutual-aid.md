Mutual aid organizations face unique security challenges. Unlike traditional nonprofits, they often operate in politically sensitive environments and may be targets of surveillance, infiltration, or repression. This guide provides practical strategies for protecting your organization and its members.

Understanding the threat landscape is crucial before implementing security measures. External threats include surveillance by government or corporate entities, infiltration by agents or informants, legal or extralegal repression, and doxxing of members' personal information. Internal threats can include burnout leading to security lapses, inadvertent information sharing through gossip, poor communication creating vulnerabilities, and lack of training resulting in risky decisions.

Secure communication forms the foundation of operational security. For digital communication, use Signal for sensitive conversations and avoid SMS for anything confidential. Consider Matrix for larger group communications and regularly update apps and devices. For email security, use encrypted services like ProtonMail or Tutanota, enable two-factor authentication, be cautious with attachments, and avoid discussing sensitive topics in email. On social media, use separate accounts for personal and organizational use, be mindful of location data in photos, don't post about future activities, and consider using pseudonyms.

For in-person communication, choose meeting locations carefully and be aware of your surroundings. Don't discuss sensitive topics in public and use code words when necessary. Keep physical documents secure, shred sensitive materials, don't leave notes in public places, and use secure storage for important files.

Protecting information is crucial for member safety and organizational effectiveness. Classify data into public information (general organizational goals, public events, contact information for inquiries, educational materials), internal information (member contact details, meeting schedules, internal processes, financial information), and confidential information (personal details of vulnerable members, security procedures, legal strategies, sources of funding). Implement access control by limiting access based on need, using secure passwords and two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing who has access to what, and following a "need to know" principle.

Physical security is equally important. For meeting spaces, choose neutral, accessible locations, avoid predictable patterns, consider multiple backup locations, and be aware of surveillance capabilities. During meetings, check for recording devices, ensure exits are accessible, have a security plan for disruptions, and know your legal rights. For events, assess potential risks, plan for different scenarios, coordinate with other organizations, and have legal observers present. During events, monitor for infiltrators, document any incidents, have medical support available, and know emergency procedures.

Member protection is paramount. For personal security, use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, keep software updated, and be cautious with public WiFi. For physical safety, vary your routines, be aware of surveillance, trust your instincts, and have emergency contacts. Support systems should include recognizing signs of burnout, providing emotional support, connecting members with resources, and creating safe spaces for discussion. For legal support, know your rights, have legal contacts ready, document incidents, and support members facing legal issues.

Organizational security requires systematic approaches. For structure and processes, use consensus-based decision making, document decisions securely, limit information to necessary people, and conduct regular security reviews. For financial security, use secure banking methods, keep financial records private, diversify funding sources, and conduct regular financial audits. Training and education should include regular security briefings, role-playing scenarios, updates on new threats, and individual security assessments. Legal education should cover knowing your rights, understanding local laws, legal observer training, and emergency legal procedures.

Despite best efforts, infiltration can still occur. Warning signs include asking too many questions, pushing for sensitive information, creating division within the group, and unusual interest in security procedures. Response procedures should include documenting suspicious behavior, discussing concerns with trusted members, implementing additional security measures, and considering removing problematic individuals. After infiltration, assess what information was compromised, update security procedures, support affected members, and learn from the experience.

Long-term security comes from building resilient organizations. Strong relationships are built through consistent action, supporting each other through challenges, creating multiple communication channels, and regular check-ins and support. Diversification means not relying on single points of failure, having multiple leaders and organizers, diverse funding sources, and various communication methods. Continuous improvement involves monthly security assessments, annual security audits, learning from incidents, and updating procedures. Adaptation requires staying informed about new threats, updating security measures, training new members, and sharing knowledge with allies.

Operational security is not about paranoia—it's about practical protection that allows your organization to continue its important work safely and effectively. By implementing these strategies thoughtfully and consistently, you can create a secure foundation for your mutual aid efforts. Remember: security is everyone's responsibility, and it's better to be prepared than to react to a crisis.
